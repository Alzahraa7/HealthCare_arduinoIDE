# HealthCare_arduinoIDE
This is my the hardware code of my Graduation project by Nodemcu and Arduino IDE
Used in this project 2 sensors: 
1- ds18b20 for digital body tempreture 
2- MAX30102 for SPO2 and Heart rate 
also I used LM35 as analog body tempreture but it's not accurate
by these sensors, patient will be measure and know his/her condition then the calculations will be send by https requests "IOT" to real time database
